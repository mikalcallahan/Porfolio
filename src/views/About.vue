      <p class='about__description'>
      I am a software developer and ui/ux designer in love with the process of designing
      and developing user experiences.
      I create full-stack solutions to web oriented needs, from e-commerce to web apps.
      Each partnership is different and the values and needs of those I work with
      always come first.
      After our goals have been defined I develop a roadmap for the project,
      iterate through designs, then development.
      I have had the pleasure of working with wonderful people including Bettina Heinz,
      Adaptive Web Studio, Heavenly Gift Baskets, and Tiled.
